### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm [@tester1121](https://github.com/tester1121), a Discord user, Discord bot maker, active GitHub user (as of 05/17/2020), and master at Scratch 1.0 - 3.0!  
I like coding, computers, Discord, and GitHub.  
I have a YouTube and Twitch channel, but I have decided not to show them on GitHub yet.  
I am currently developing a website that will be available under [this URL (there is nothing there for now).](https://tester1121.github.io)  
My Discord username is 1121#1063, and I will soon have a server!!!  
I do have many fails, but I keep the successful parts for myself.  
If you are still reading this, you should really check out my third puzzle! You can begin the puzzle at [this link (blank for now)](), but you will need to have a Discord account that you don't mind giving the username out.  
So, bye for now!
